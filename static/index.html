    <h1>Emotions for HN</h1>

	<small>I am not a native English speaker, please ignore syntactical and semantical mistakes.</small>
    <p>
      I see a lot of 'HN is no more like old days' or 'HN has a lot of toxicity' comment these days. 
      Sometimes it is just a difference of opinions (which is understandable) but sometimes it escalates 
      to hostile behavior and unnecessary personal attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      So this is just a tini-tiny experiment to see whether people will have an impact if their comment
      is flagged as having some form of positive or negative emotional effect on others. It can also 
      be used to avoid certain comments if you are not interested in seeing those comments.
    </p>
      
    <p>
     <strong>Emotions for HN</strong> is a Chrome/Firefox plugin I wrote over a weekend, which adds a UI control to each comment showing 5
     emotions (listed below). Anybody can vote on these emotions and each comment will show how 
     much emotions it accumulated. Supported emotions:
     </p>
     <ul>
     	<li>Empathetic</li>
      	<li>Encouraging</li>
      	<li>Ad Hominem</li>
      	<li>Flame war</li>
      	<li>Discouraging</li>
     </ul>
     
     <p>
     The emotion having the highest vote on certain comment labeled as an emotion of that comment.
     So e.g. certain comment has a large number of vote for 'Empathetic' then the comment is 
     labeled as empathetic. You can also enable <code>emotion-highlighting</code> where you can see all the
     comments which are labeled with given emotion. See below screenshot.
